# Notice
### This is an official application owned by Nintendo and I do not own it.
#### - Your 3DS must have CFW to install the prototype application.
# Installation
## Method I: GodMode9 Installation
To install the devkit using GodMode9, follow this method.
### 1. Start the GodMode9 File Manager.
#### - Power off your console.
#### There are two methods of opening GodMode9.
##### Method I: Open GodMode9 using the Luma3DS boot chainloader. This can be accessed by holding the SELECT button while powering on your 3DS.
##### Method II: Press and hold START while powering on your console.
You will now be redirected to the file manager (GodMode9). The guide uses the official GodMode9, meaning that if you have a modded GodMode9 or a fork, chances are some changes may apply.
